# TCP Pinger

Simple TCP pinger written in Java. Check out my UDP pinger as well at https://github.com/superrmatt/UDPPinger <br/>
<br/>
This was used to ping a raspberry pi I kept at home to ensure it was still alive, default ping rate is every hour. <br/>
<br/>
Can set the rate of pings, port, server ip in Driver.java. <br/>
Can set the message in Connector.java. <br/>
<br/>
Happy pinging!
